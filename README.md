## Create your first container app

Use the `Deploy Project from Workspace...` command to simplify the process of deploying a local workspace project to a container app!  By analyzing your project directory, we automatically detect any Dockerfiles and generate all the necessary Azure resources required for creating a containerized application (monorepo support now included!).

Please follow our onboarding walkthrough to get started. You can access the walkthrough using either of the following methods:
* Click the workspace container apps icon and run `Open Walkthrough`

* Open through the command palette `F1 > Azure Container Apps: Open Walkthrough`


You can re-run the command with your saved workspace settings to quickly re-deploy your project to any previously saved Azure resources.

__Note__: We also have entry-points on the container apps environment item (`Create Container App from Workspace`) and the container app item (`Deploy Workspace to Container App`).  These commands offer an alternative way to quickly target project deployment to existing resources.

## Edit and deploy your app

_Draft support has only been added for these actions: Scaling commands, Update Container Image..., Edit Container App (Advanced)_

1. Make a supported edit to your container app. In this example we will be editing the scaling range.
1. Changes made to your container app will be reflected by the appended "*" and the "Unsaved changes" tag added to the container app

1. More changes can be made and deployed together!
1. Deploy these changes to your container app by clicking the cloud icon located next to your container app

    ![deployDraft](resources/readme/deployDraft.png)
1. Once your deployment has completed your changes should accurately be reflected in the Azure view!
